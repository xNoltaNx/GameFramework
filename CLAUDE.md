# Claude Code Guidelines for GameFramework

## Unity Development Notes

- Do NOT create .meta files manually - Unity will generate them automatically
- Do NOT attempt to test Unity-specific changes via command line
- Focus on code implementation and let Unity handle asset management
- When refactoring, prioritize code structure and maintainability over immediate testing
